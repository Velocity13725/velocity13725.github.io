    <p>I want to sincerely apologize for back talking to you. I realize my words were hurtful, and I am truly sorry for any pain I may have caused. Please forgive me.</p>
    <p>Let's talk and work things out. I value our relationship, and I don't want anything to come between us.</p>
    <p>Sorry again, and I hope we can move forward.</p>
